Thanks to the hyperconnectivity that we have and a poor education about security and privacy we do not realize the footprint that we leave while doing our daily actions. Some examples could be when we rent a car and then connect the cell phone by bluethooth. We can synchronize all our contacts to the car without realizing it. Then when we return the car, the next user will have access to all our contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to share some tools that will help us to protect our privacy and security in the internet world. Sometimes, we think that to protect ourselves we need to know about computers or invest money. But in this post I will show some free options that will improve our current situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hell’s access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping different passwords is a tough task. Also, you need to change them from time to time. Moreover with the huge amount of accounts we create day to day it is really hard to keep passwords secure and avoid duplicating them.
Finally but not less important several web pages/services were vulnarated by hackers. Getting to uncover our emails and sometimes even our passwords. This situation allows hacker to try in other web pages or services with these credentials creating a net of vulnerabilities. In this way not just our social media can be attacked, but also our home banking account and so on.
You can check if your email has been compromised in the following sites, &lt;a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/"&gt;Mozilla Monitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Pwned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem is as simple as downloading a password generator. This kind of application will create secure and strong passwords and avoid repeating them. From our side we just need to remember one or two strong secure passwords to get access to the application. Then using the application plug-in for the most modern web browser it will suggest auto-fill our credentials into the log-in pages.
I suggest using &lt;a href="https://www.avira.com/en/password-manager"&gt;Avira Password Manager&lt;/a&gt; because you can manage from both our mobile phone (Android, iOS) and laptop all your access. There are other applications that do the same work but they do not provide in the free tier the access to multiple devices at same time. From my point of view, it is a kill breaker feature because we use one or another depending on how we are moving along our day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two factor authentication (F2A)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays having strong passwords is not enough to keep all our access safe. So we should activate (in pages or services that allow us) the second factor authentication.
This second code is a six digit password that changes periodically and will be requested after logged-in into a web page/service. Also if we want to do some actions inside a web page such as sell some of our crypto.
To register the F2A, the application will scan a QR code with an application destined for that. From this blog we suggest use &lt;a href="https://authy.com/"&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt; because we can use it from our laptop or mobile device as well as keep all the codes synchronized between them. This is important because if we do not backup the recovery codes (a sheet with one or more codes given after registering the F2A), we will have a last chance to recover all our codes in case of lost or robbery of our personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last advice is &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; and be &lt;strong&gt;careful&lt;/strong&gt;. Each time a message is prompted, an unknown email takes some time to read and doubt about it. In this way we will know what we are doing and avoid be catched in some threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reducing our digital footprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several times we were talking with friends about a new amazing bike, later we realized that we start seeing bike ads in social media or web browsing. The fact is our devices are listening to us. Also the installed applications that we use on our daily basis are collecting information about  you or where we are moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Radical changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is the most famous and well known browser for all of us. But it‚Äôs the most intrusive because it records our data such as geo location (then they can suggest posts based on your location), preferences, etc without our consent. We can check this fact in the curated advertising that we will see in web pages or even among our search.
There are other search engine options. In particular the one that I have been using since 13 years ago, it is &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;. This engine does not track you and do not save nor sell our data related. Also we will see annoying advertising everywhere. A plus is that DuckDuckGo provides us with some extra commands in the search engine(for example if we put to search “jorge luis borges !w”, the &lt;strong&gt;!w&lt;/strong&gt; command will show us the result in Wikipedia directly). There are several commands waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another improvement in our browsing is to start using &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/privacy-badger"&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt;. It is a browser extension for all modern web browsers. This plug-in blocks libraries such as Google Analytics or hidden trackers embedded into the web pages. With that we will avoid the tracking and subsequent sale of this data to third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time that we install a new application into our mobiles, they require in some manner to grant access to different mobile resources such as microphone, localization and so on. We should spend some time checking for those permissions that do not need to be accessed all the time and just allow them when we will use the application. Moreover we need to pay attention to those applications that request permission for resources that are not required for their right working. For example a stopwatch does not need access to our contact agenda or location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smart assistance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, all our smartphones provide intelligent assistance that records part of our talks even when we are not using them. Hence we must keep them turned off and just use them when we need.
Below I will share with you how to turn off the assistances for Android and iOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deactivate "Hey Siri" (iOS):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration &amp;gt; Siri &amp;amp; Search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle off "Listen for Hey Siri".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle off "Allow Siri when Locked".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deactivate "Ok Google" (Android):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google &amp;gt; Account Service &amp;gt; Search, Assistance and Voice &amp;gt; Voice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice Match and turn off Hey Google.&lt;/li&gt;

Nowadays I am not an active collaborator for any initiative but I always try to help when is possible. But this post is not about how I started whit the open source at least not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2021 I read a tweet from a friend of mine and I figured out two things. First one, there are an organization called &lt;a href="https://www.dataumbrella.org/"&gt;Data Umbrella&lt;/a&gt; (DU aims to create inclusive spaces and share technology knowledge), secondly there was a sprint of Scikit-learn focused in Latin America.  This post will be about the second topic.
Finally I decided to register to the &lt;a href="https://latam2021.dataumbrella.org/"&gt;Data Umbrella:  2021 Latin America scikit-learn open source sprint&lt;/a&gt;.
This not be the first time that I’m involve in this kind of event but the first time ever that I contribute to an important and big library such as scikit-learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a general view the event was a great experience to interact and meet to core library developers as well as other people in LatAm.
The organization was neat, they have a lot of document and pre work to put your hand on in the event day. Also you have your partner already asigned and a curated list of issue to tackle.
Data Umbrella organization tackle very well the language barrier and that was a plus. All the people involve could gave their part to collaborate in the library.
You do not need to be super smart or an expert in machine learning to help.
All of these points allowed to create an atmosphere in where all of the participant with their time and capacities can bring the best of them and generate a postive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we do not finished our issue (our &lt;a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20424"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; is open yet) I will participate in this kind of event again. Moreover I’m thinking in finish the pending requested changes and merge the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of events give us the opportunity to learn something new, expand our knowledge in different areas and finally help to a library that the most of us use in our daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about the event and their statistics check this amazing &lt;a href="https://reshamas.github.io/data-umbrella-latam-2021-scikit-learn-sprint-report/"&gt;post sprint report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Mockig a database cursor instance in Python</title><link href="/articles/2021/01/29/mockig-a-cursor-db/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-29T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2021-01-29T00:00:00-03:00</updated><author><name>nestornav</name></author><id>tag:None,2021-01-29:/articles/2021/01/29/mockig-a-cursor-db/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found an issue recently, when I tried to mock a function that has the following behavior.

There is a query to database to fetch several rows, the result is a cursor that will be iterated later. Hence each iteration will write a file with the result.
The designed test assert if the function write or not the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A code example about my first attemp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;output_csv.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The folling function retrive a db connection instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_connection_db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;conn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fetchone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Function to test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;process_query_result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;csv_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;st_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test aims to mock both a new database connection and the cursor. Later that the cursor will be iterated and after call &lt;code&gt;fetchone&lt;/code&gt; the result will be written as a line into the file.
In this case I used the property &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.return_value"&gt;return_value&lt;/a&gt; from mock. This property will return a list of integer each time that &lt;code&gt;cursor&lt;/code&gt; is consumed from &lt;code&gt;process_query_result&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test step described before did not work also I needed to interrupt the execution due to the test never end. That situation happent because the function &lt;code&gt;process_query_result&lt;/code&gt; use a while statement over the cursor and never break the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little bit of debuging time, I found which was my mistake. The property &lt;code&gt;return_value&lt;/code&gt; returned the full list of integers each time that &lt;code&gt;fetch_one&lt;/code&gt; function of the cursor was called. So the loop never reaches the end in consequence the iterator never got an &lt;code&gt;StopIteration&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I was looking for from the very first time was the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.side_effect"&gt;side_effect&lt;/a&gt; property. This one has more or less the following behave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can either be a function to be called when the mock is called, an iterable or an exception (class or instance) to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eureka! what I needed! Something that mimics an iterable! From now &lt;code&gt;fetchone&lt;/code&gt; will not reutrn the full list. Finally I needed just tweak a single line as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fetchone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;side_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;return_fav_list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the test ran right this time. In a nutshell if you need mock an iterable instance inside a fuction, the best option will be use &lt;code&gt;side_effect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Nuevo post test</title><link href="/articles/2020/05/25/test/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-25T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2020-05-25T00:00:00-03:00</updated><author><name>nestornav</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-05-25:/articles/2020/05/25/test/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Como todo principio, hay un Hola Mundo!.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry></feed>
